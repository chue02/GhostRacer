To run GhostRacer:

1. Locate the folder GhostRacer, which should have in it files named
GhostRacer and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/GhostRacer or /Users/yourname/Downloads/GhostRacer.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the GhostRacer
folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
        ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the GhostRacer executable.

4. Type
        ./GhostRacer
to play the game.

5. If GhostRacer is not an executable, then you may need to type the 
command:
        chmod +x GhostRacer
in your terminal and repeat step 4.
